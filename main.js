// Your game logic methods must include, but are not limited to:
// A function that creates the objects that store each players‚Äô informations - properties should include: id (ex: 'one'), token (ex: '‚≠êÔ∏è'), wins (ex: 0)
// A function called increaseWins - increases the count of a player‚Äôs wins (should work for either player)
// A function that keeps track of the data for the game board
// A function that keeps track of which player‚Äôs turn it currently is
// A function that checks the game board data for win conditions
// A function that detects when a game is a draw (no one has won)
// A function that resets the game board‚Äôs data to begin a new game


// Create the functions that describe/update the players and their data
// Create the functions that describe/update the game board and gameplay
// Reflect: without thinking about the DOM, could you call all the necessary functions that a game would need in order to function? Would your data update properly? Would your game be able to know when someone has won? etc
// Create central game board on the DOM and connect it to the game‚Äôs data
// Display each player‚Äôs data in the sidebars
// Connect the data model to the DOM - ensure that the data model updates based on user interaction
// Automatically reset the game board to allow for a new game to be played after the previous game is won
